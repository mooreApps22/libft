# Libft 
## This custom library consists of 49 functions

Libft consists of custom recreations of many of the most used C standard functions and several utility functions for linked lists. The use of libraries and archives of executables is one of the most fundamental skills in Computer Programming.

The Makefile used the  GNU ```ar``` programs to create an archive. The archive file has an .a file extention. This archive is used as a library holding many subroutines which you can then use in any C program. 

To use this library in C program you must compile the .a file with the C program. 

```cc hello_world.c libft.a```
